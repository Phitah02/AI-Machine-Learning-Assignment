## üéØ Project Overview

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict renewable energy adoption rates across countries, supporting the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7: **Affordable and Clean Energy**. By forecasting renewable energy transitions, policymakers can:

- Set realistic clean energy targets
- Allocate resources effectively
- Track progress toward carbon neutrality
- Plan infrastructure investments

**ML Approach:** Supervised Learning (Regression)

**Models Used:**
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## üåü Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Despite global commitments to clean energy, many countries struggle to transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Key challenges include:

1. **Lack of predictive insights** for energy policy planning
2. **Resource allocation inefficiencies** in clean energy investments
3. **Difficulty setting achievable targets** based on country-specific factors
4. **Limited understanding** of which factors most influence renewable adoption

### How AI Helps

Our ML model predicts renewable energy adoption rates based on:
- Economic indicators (GDP, energy intensity)
- Current energy infrastructure (fossil fuel vs. renewable capacity)
- Geographic factors (location, land area)
- Social metrics (electricity access, population density)

This enables data-driven decision-making for sustainable energy transitions.

## üîß Solution Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values using median imputation
- Feature selection based on domain knowledge
- Standard scaling for numerical features
- Train-test split (80-20)

### 2. Model Training
We compare three supervised learning algorithms:

**Linear Regression:** Baseline model for interpretability
**Random Forest:** Ensemble method handling non-linear relationships
**Gradient Boosting:** Advanced boosting for high accuracy

### 3. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average prediction error
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Penalizes large errors
- **R¬≤ Score:** Percentage of variance explained
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold CV for robustness

### 4. Feature Importance Analysis
Identifies which factors most influence renewable energy adoption

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

### Bias Analysis

**Data Representation Bias:**
- Historical data may favor developed countries with better data collection
- Missing data from conflict zones or developing nations
- **Mitigation:** Median imputation and balanced feature selection

**Algorithmic Fairness:**
- Model should not disadvantage countries with less renewable infrastructure
- Predictions account for different economic and geographic contexts
- **Mitigation:** Include GDP, geography, and social factors as features

### Sustainability Impact

**Positive Impacts:**
- Supports evidence-based policymaking for clean energy
- Helps countries set realistic, achievable targets
- Promotes transparency in energy transition planning
- Contributes directly to SDG 7 goals

**Limitations:**
- Predictions are guidance tools, not replacements for human judgment
- Must consider local context, culture, and political factors
- Model accuracy depends on data quality and completeness

### Data Privacy

- Uses aggregated country-level data (no individual privacy concerns)
- All data sources are publicly available and open-source
- Complies with ethical AI guidelines
