# Predicting the Future of Clean Energy: How Machine Learning Can Accelerate SDG 7

## Introduction: The Clean Energy Challenge

In 2015, world leaders committed to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030 through the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7. Yet today, billions still lack access to clean energy, and the transition from fossil fuels remains one of humanity's greatest challenges.

The question isn't just "Can we transition to renewable energy?" but rather "How quickly can we do it, and what factors will make the difference?"

This is where Artificial Intelligence enters the conversation.

## The Problem: Why Countries Struggle with Renewable Energy Adoption

### The Current Landscape

As of 2020, renewable energy accounts for approximately 29% of global electricity generation. While this represents progress, the pace of adoption varies dramatically between countries. Some nations like Norway and Iceland generate over 90% of their electricity from renewables, while others remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

### Key Challenges

1. **Unpredictable Transitions:** Countries struggle to forecast their renewable energy adoption rates, making it difficult to plan infrastructure and investments.

2. **Resource Allocation:** Without predictive insights, governments can't effectively allocate budgets for solar panels, wind farms, or hydroelectric dams.

3. **Unrealistic Targets:** Many countries set ambitious renewable energy goals without understanding the factors that influence adoption success.

4. **Lack of Data-Driven Insights:** Policymakers often lack tools to understand which interventions will have the greatest impact.

## The Solution: Machine Learning for Energy Forecasting

### Our Approach

I developed a **Renewable Energy Adoption Predictor** using supervised machine learning to forecast renewable energy adoption rates based on historical data from 176 countries over 20 years (2000-2020).

### How It Works

The system analyzes multiple factors that influence renewable energy adoption:

**Economic Indicators:**
- GDP per capita
- GDP growth rate
- Energy intensity of the economy

**Energy Infrastructure:**
- Current electricity from renewables
- Fossil fuel electricity generation
- Nuclear energy capacity

**Social Factors:**
- Population with access to electricity
- Access to clean cooking fuels
- Population density

**Geographic Features:**
- Country location (latitude/longitude)
- Land area
- Natural resource availability

**Environmental Metrics:**
- CO2 emissions per capita
- Low-carbon electricity percentage

### The Machine Learning Pipeline

**Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned 3,649 data points across 21 features
- Handled missing values using median imputation
- Applied standard scaling for numerical features
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets

**Step 2: Model Training**
We compared three supervised learning algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression:** A baseline model providing interpretability
2. **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble method that handles non-linear relationships
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Advanced boosting algorithm for maximum accuracy

**Step 3: Model Evaluation**
Each model was evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score (percentage of variance explained)
- 5-fold Cross-Validation

---

## The Results: What We Discovered

### Model Performance

After rigorous testing, the **Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the best-performing model, achieving:
- High R² score indicating strong predictive power
- Low prediction errors on unseen country data
- Robust cross-validation results

### Key Insights

**Most Influential Factors for Renewable Energy Adoption:**

1. **Current Renewable Infrastructure:** Countries with existing renewable energy capacity are more likely to expand it further.

2. **Economic Development (GDP per capita):** Wealthier nations have more resources to invest in clean energy infrastructure.

3. **Access to Clean Cooking Fuels:** This indicator reflects overall energy access and infrastructure development.

4. **Energy Intensity:** Countries with higher energy efficiency tend to adopt renewables faster.

5. **Geographic Location:** Solar and wind potential vary significantly by latitude and climate.

### Real-World Applications

**For Policymakers:**
- Set evidence-based renewable energy targets
- Identify which factors to prioritize for maximum impact
- Allocate budgets more effectively across clean energy initiatives
- Track progress against predictions and adjust strategies

**For International Organizations:**
- Identify countries that need additional support
- Prioritize resource allocation for development aid
- Monitor global progress toward SDG 7 targets

**For Investors:**
- Assess renewable energy investment opportunities
- Evaluate country-specific risks and opportunities
- Make data-driven decisions about clean energy projects

## Ethical Considerations: Building Responsible AI

### Addressing Bias

**Challenge:** Historical data may favor developed countries with better data collection systems, potentially creating biased predictions that disadvantage developing nations.

**Our Approach:**
- Included economic, geographic, and social factors to account for different starting points
- Used median imputation rather than dropping data from countries with missing information
- Validated model performance across diverse regions
- Made the model transparent and explainable

### Fairness and Equity

**Principle:** AI should not perpetuate existing inequalities in energy access.

**Implementation:**
- The model considers each country's unique context
- Features include both economic capacity and infrastructure gaps
- Predictions account for different development stages
- Results are meant to guide, not dictate, human decision-making

### Data Privacy and Transparency

- All data used is publicly available and aggregated at country level
- No individual or corporate data is involved
- Model methodology is open-source and reproducible
- Results are interpretable and explainable to non-technical stakeholders

### Sustainability of AI Itself

Machine learning models consume energy. We addressed this by:
- Using efficient algorithms (tree-based methods over deep learning where appropriate)
- Training once and deploying for multiple predictions
- Providing tools that prevent wasteful energy investments
- Net positive impact: Better energy planning saves far more energy than the model consumes
